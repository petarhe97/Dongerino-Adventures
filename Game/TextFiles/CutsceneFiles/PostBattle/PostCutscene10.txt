And so, Dongerino defeated the trash player Lazy and stopped his scheme. Lazy still never learned, but this time, was finally caught and was to never interact with the Doto community again. In the end, the community is free of one more trash player... Dongerino, with his new found wealth from saving the country, chose to form a professional team with some of the people that went with him against the trash player. Needless to say, he was very successful in the scene, eating many lunches and winning many tournaments. The end... but unfortunately... there will always be trash players.
